## Credit Risk Analysis Machine Learing Project

Credit Risk Analysis

Project Description:
This project aims to predict whether a customer will default on their loan using machine learning techniques. A classification model is built to analyze customer data and assess their creditworthiness.

Technologies:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Data:

A cleaned dataset containing 8 columns relevant to credit risk analysis.
Methodology:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized data distributions, correlations, and relationships between features.
Identified potential outliers and missing values.
Gained insights into customer behavior and credit risk factors.
Model Development:

Implemented a logistic regression model as a baseline.
Employed gradient boosting techniques to enhance model performance.
Utilized cross-validation to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Employed RandomSearchCV to optimize model parameters and achieve the best performance.
Evaluation:

Calculated the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score to measure model accuracy.
Determined Type I and Type II error rates to assess the model's ability to correctly classify positive and negative cases.
Results:

Achieved an AUC score of 82%, indicating good predictive power.
Obtained Type I and Type II error rates of 22% and 35% respectively, demonstrating a balance between false positives and false negatives.
Future Work:

Explore other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for comparison.
Incorporate additional features or data sources to improve model accuracy.
Investigate techniques to reduce Type I and Type II error rates further.
